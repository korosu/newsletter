## Overview

### The challenge

  - The field is left empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- TailwindCSS

### What I learned

My first JS/React/Next/TailwindCSS project
required a lot of research.
Everything was new to me,
but I had a lot of fun with it.
However, it also made me feel tired at times.
The most difficult part in the project was typography and layout.
The project looks complete, but the details are not up to par, especially in terms of code optimization. I have a feeling that there will be a lot of bugs.

### Thanks
